### FUNCTION CLASSIFICATION

**CORE FUNCTIONS (require detailed analysis):**
- `acquire_lock`: Implements the core spin lock acquisition with busy-waiting semantics
- `try_acquire_lock`: Attempts atomic lock acquisition using compare-and-exchange operation
- `release_lock`: Releases the spin lock by atomically setting lock state to false

**SUPPORTING FUNCTIONS (brief summary):**
- `new`: Constructor for spin lock initialization - Model as simple state initialization
- `lock`: Creates lock guard with guardian behavior - Model as acquire_lock + guard creation
- `lock_arc`: Arc-based lock acquisition - Model same as lock but with Arc reference counting abstracted
- `try_lock`: Non-blocking lock attempt - Model as conditional try_acquire_lock + guard creation
- `get_mut`: Mutable access bypass for exclusive ownership - Model as direct access when lock unused
- `disable_irq`: Guard behavior conversion - Abstract as guard type change

**INFRASTRUCTURE FUNCTIONS (to omit):**
- `fmt::Debug` implementations: Debug formatting - Omitted
- `Deref`/`DerefMut` implementations: Trait implementations for guard access - Omitted
- `Drop` implementation: Cleanup logic calling release_lock - Model only the release_lock call
- Safety trait implementations (`Send`/`Sync`): Thread safety markers - Omitted

### DETAILED CORE FUNCTION ANALYSIS

### acquire_lock
- **Signature**: `fn acquire_lock(&self)`
- **Purpose**: Acquires the spin lock through busy-waiting until successful atomic acquisition
- **Protocol Component**: Mutual Exclusion/Synchronization
- **Critical Logic**:
  • Condition: `try_acquire_lock() == false` → Action: Continue spinning with `spin_loop()`
  • Condition: `try_acquire_lock() == true` → Action: Exit loop and acquire lock
- **Modeling Approach**: Full modeling required - represents core mutual exclusion protocol with busy-waiting semantics

### try_acquire_lock  
- **Signature**: `fn try_acquire_lock(&self) -> bool`
- **Purpose**: Performs atomic compare-and-exchange to attempt lock acquisition without blocking
- **Protocol Component**: Mutual Exclusion/Atomic Operations
- **Critical Logic**:
  • Condition: `atomic_lock == false` → Action: Set to `true` with Acquire ordering, return `true`
  • Condition: `atomic_lock == true` → Action: No change, return `false`
- **Modeling Approach**: Full modeling required - represents atomic state transition critical for correctness

### release_lock
- **Signature**: `fn release_lock(&self)`
- **Purpose**: Releases the spin lock by atomically storing false with Release ordering
- **Protocol Component**: Mutual Exclusion/Synchronization
- **Critical Logic**:
  • Action: Unconditionally set `atomic_lock = false` with Release memory ordering
- **Modeling Approach**: Full modeling required - represents critical state transition enabling other processes to acquire lock

### ESSENTIAL STATE VARIABLES:
- `lock: AtomicBool`: Core synchronization primitive representing lock state (false=unlocked, true=locked)
- `val: UnsafeCell<T>`: Protected data accessible only when lock is held
- `guard: G::Guard`: Guardian behavior state managing preemption/IRQ disable during lock hold
