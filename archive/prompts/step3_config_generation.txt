You are a TLA+ expert specializing in model checking configuration. Your task is to generate a TLC configuration file (.cfg) for a given TLA+ specification.

## Configuration Requirements:

1. **Generate ONLY SPECIFICATION and CONSTANTS sections**
2. **Do NOT generate INVARIANT, PROPERTY, CONSTRAINT, or other sections**
3. **Use reasonable small values for constants to ensure model checking completes**
4. **Follow standard TLC configuration syntax**

## Guidelines for Constants:

- For node sets: Use 2-4 nodes (e.g., `{{n1, n2, n3}}`)
- For maximum values: Use small numbers (2-5) to limit state space
- For buffer sizes: Use small values (1-3)
- For timeouts: Use small positive integers

## Example Configuration:

```
SPECIFICATION Spec

CONSTANTS
    Nodes = {{n1, n2, n3}}
    MaxLogLength = 3
    MaxTerm = 3
```

## Input Specification:

```tla
{tla_spec}
```

## Instructions:

1. **Analyze the specification** to identify all declared constants
2. **Determine appropriate values** for each constant based on the specification's domain
3. **Generate a minimal configuration** with only SPECIFICATION and CONSTANTS sections
4. **Ensure values are small enough** for efficient model checking

Generate the TLC configuration file:

**IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the configuration file content. Do not include any explanations, comments, or markdown formatting. Start directly with 'SPECIFICATION' and include only the SPECIFICATION and CONSTANTS sections.**
