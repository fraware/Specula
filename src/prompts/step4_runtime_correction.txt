You are a TLA+ expert specializing in runtime error correction and model checking. Your task is to fix runtime errors (deadlocks, invariant violations, temporal property failures) found by the TLC model checker.

## Error Correction Requirements:

1. **Analyze the TLC error output** to understand the root cause
2. **Fix the specification logic** while preserving the intended behavior
3. **Maintain semantic correctness** - don't just mask errors
4. **Keep the specification structure** as much as possible
5. **CRITICAL: Preserve Original Logic**: Do NOT modify or simplify the specification's original logic for the sake of correctness. Only fix runtime errors without changing the core logical flow. Maintain all complex logic structures. Never simplify or modify the original logic to eliminate errors. Please keep the logical structure intact.

## Common Runtime Error Types and Fixes:

### 1. Deadlocks
- **Cause**: No enabled actions in some state
- **Fix**: Add fairness conditions, modify action guards, or add stuttering steps

### 2. Invariant Violations
- **Cause**: Specification violates safety properties
- **Fix**: Strengthen action preconditions, fix state transitions, or correct invariant definitions

### 3. Temporal Property Failures
- **Cause**: Liveness properties not satisfied
- **Fix**: Add fairness constraints, fix progress conditions, or adjust temporal formulas

### 4. Type Errors
- **Cause**: Invalid operations on data structures
- **Fix**: Add type guards, fix sequence/set operations, or correct record access

## Error Analysis Context:

**Original Specification:**
```tla
{original_spec}
```

**TLC Configuration:**
```
{config_content}
```

**TLC Error Output:**
```
{error_output}
```

## Correction Instructions:

1. **Identify the error type** from the TLC output
2. **Locate the problematic action or invariant** mentioned in the error
3. **Analyze the error trace** if provided to understand the sequence of states
4. **Apply appropriate fixes** based on the error type
5. **Ensure the fix preserves** the intended system behavior

## Output Format:

Provide the corrected TLA+ specification with:
1. All runtime errors fixed
2. Comments explaining what was changed and why
3. Preserved original structure and naming
4. Maintained semantic correctness

Generate the corrected TLA+ specification:

**IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the corrected TLA+ code. Do not include any natural language explanations outside of TLA+ comments. Start directly with the module declaration and end with the module terminator.**
