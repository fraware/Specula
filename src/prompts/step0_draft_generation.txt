You are a TLA+ specification expert. Your task is to analyze source code and generate a concise technical summary to enable precise TLA+ specification conversion. Focus on code-level accuracy and structured analysis.

## Objective:
Produce a concise technical summary of functions from the source code to enable precise TLA+ specification conversion. Focus on code-level accuracy and LLM-friendly structure.

## Processing Requirements:

### Function Analysis:
Identify and categorize functions into:
• **Core protocol logic** (e.g., consensus algorithms, state transitions) - requires detailed analysis
• **Supporting operations** (e.g., validation, utility functions) - brief summary only
• **Infrastructure code** (e.g., logging, networking, timers) - one line mention

### Function Documentation:
**For CORE functions only (detailed analysis):**
a. Declare signature with input/output types
b. Describe primary purpose in 1 sentence
c. Map to system protocol phase/component
d. Flag critical control flows affecting state transitions

**For NON-CORE functions (brief summary):**
a. One line describing role and modeling approach

### Modeling Decisions:
**Full Modeling Required for:**
• State machine transition logic
• Term/version comparison logic
• Protocol-critical condition checks
• Consensus and consistency mechanisms

**Abstract when:**
• Network I/O operations (e.g., sendRPC, network calls)
• Timer management (e.g., timeout handling)
• Non-deterministic utilities
• Performance optimizations

**Omit completely:**
• Logging/debug/tracing calls
• Metrics and monitoring
• Error formatting and display

## Source Code to Analyze:

{source_code}

## Output Format:

Present in structured markdown with:

### FUNCTION CLASSIFICATION

**CORE FUNCTIONS (require detailed analysis):**
- [Function Name]: [One sentence description]
- [Function Name]: [One sentence description]
...

**SUPPORTING FUNCTIONS (brief summary):**
- [Function Name]: [Brief role/purpose] - [Modeling Approach]
- [Function Name]: [Brief role/purpose] - [Modeling Approach]
...

**INFRASTRUCTURE FUNCTIONS (to omit):**
- [Function Name]: [Brief description] - Omitted
- [Function Name]: [Brief description] - Omitted
...

### DETAILED CORE FUNCTION ANALYSIS

### [Core Function Name]
- **Signature**: `func(...) ...`
- **Purpose**: [One sentence description]
- **Protocol Component**: [Election/Replication/Consensus/Utility]
- **Critical Logic**:
  • Condition: [specific comparison/check] → Action: [state change]
  • [List key conditional flows and state modifications]
- **Modeling Approach**: [Full/Abstracted with reasoning]

[Repeat detailed analysis ONLY for core functions]

---

### ESSENTIAL STATE VARIABLES:
- [Variable Name]: [Type and purpose in protocol]
- [Variable Name]: [Type and purpose in protocol]

---

## Validation Rules:
• Cross-validate function calls and dependencies
• Preserve execution order dependencies between functions
• Highlight any non-idempotent operations
• Ensure balanced coverage of all protocol components

**Focus on producing a translation-ready technical summary that preserves algorithmic correctness.**
