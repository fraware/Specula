You are a TLA+ expert. Generate a complete TLC configuration file (.cfg) that can be directly saved and used for model checking.

## Input Specification:

```tla
{tla_spec}
```

## Requirements:

1. **Analyze the specification** to identify the main specification name and all declared constants
2. **Generate complete .cfg file content** with SPECIFICATION and CONSTANTS sections
3. **Use small values for constants** to ensure efficient model checking (2-4 nodes, small integers)
4. **Output ONLY the raw .cfg file content** - no explanations, no markdown, no code blocks

## Example Output Format:

SPECIFICATION SpecName

CONSTANTS
    Nodes = {{n1, n2, n3}}
    MaxValue = 3
    BufferSize = 2

**Your response must be the complete .cfg file content that can be directly written to a file and used by TLC. Start your response immediately with "SPECIFICATION" and include nothing else.**
